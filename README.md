## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project involves a detailed analysis of a Multinational IT Company's sales data collected from crm tools using Power BI. The goal is to gain valuable insights and answer various business questions faced by stakeholders based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed information of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions. The dataset includes information about open sales pipelines and closed sales deals across company's various locations globally.

## Objective 

- Use Power BI to analyze and visualize the CRM sales data to investigate the sales performance across regions, countries, and products.
- Visualize total sales, perhaps through a line chart or a bar chart, showing trends over time.
- A slicer or filter for selecting specific regions, countries, industries and services.
- Visualizations that show sales distribution across selected dimensions.
- A map visualization that displays sales geographically based on the selected filters

## Meta-Data

### 1. TCV (Total contract value)

Measures the total value of a customer contract, including one-time fees, service fees, and recurring charges. It's useful for assessing the health of a company's customer base. TCV is a more accurate projection of future revenue.


### 2. ACV (Anuual contract value)

Measures the average annual revenue a customer generates for a business. It's useful for assessing sales team performance and understanding revenue growth from new bookings. ACV is calculated by dividing the total contract value by the number of years in the contract.

### 3. Closed Deals

Refer to sales opportunities that have been successfully completed and finalized, meaning a customer has signed a contract and the sale is considered as "won".

### 4. Open Pipeline

Represents all the potential sales opportunities currently in progress at various stages of the sales process, meaning they haven't been closed yet and are still being actively pursued by the sales team.

### 5. Closed Won

A deal that was successfully closed and a prospect became a customer. This could be a new customer acquisition or upselling an existing customer.

### 6. Closed Lost

A deal that was pursued but did not result in a successful sale.

## Data Transformation Steps 

- Appended the two datasets named "Open Piplines" & "Closed Deals" into one inside the power query as they were smaller in size to 
  simplify the data transformation and analysis.
- Removed un-necessary columns from the datasets as they were irrelevent to the analysis and may occupy un-necessary space.
- After carefully examining the dataset it was found that the dataset was mostly clean except some data formatting issues which are 
  listed below
  
  1. AccountId >> Account Id in both datasets.
  
  2. As USA & United States both present in countries column >> USA replaced to United States.
 
  3. LiveLife(Mexico) & LiveLife(Mexico ) both present in Account Name Column >> LiveLife(Mexico ) to LiveLife(Mexico).
 
  4. Industry column was not present in closed_deals, hence in appended table it becomes empty in 69%. Used dax function to create new 
     industry column.
     
  5. Calculated TCV - ACV >> Using DAX Measures.
  
  6. Created YEAR column from Close Date.
  
  7. Created Calculated Column Stage 2 to slice values based on "Closed Deals" & "Open Pipeline".

### 5. Based on the insights provided in the report, what specific actions would you recommend to the stakeholders to optimize their selling strategy ?

Ans. Roli Manjusha, Adrian French, Capri Sam have been performing exceptionally well in terms of bringing absolute TCV for the company. Their efforts should get recognition and company should utilize their expertise and mentorship for motivating other opportunity owners to perform better for the company. 

## Findings 

Though we found out the targated dimensions i.e. services, countries with highest/lowest TCV margin % but according to sheer value we get compltely different dimensions. 

For example Mexico has the highest percentage of TCV margin of 47.89% but it has TCV of only 0.46 Million Dollers. While United States has TCV margin percentage of 29.34%, but it has highest TCV of 813.59 Million Dollers.

Also our sales has drastically dropped in 2025 from 2024, though they have increased from 2023 to 2024

## Conclusion 

- As we discovered while changing the percentage margin of TCV with it's sheer value, we get completly different dimensions. So while it's good to analyze the dimensions on margin percentages but it is also important to pay attention to sheer value.
- It is imporatnt to pay attention to countries like Mexico, Spain & Chile whcich are bringing high % of TCV margin but low on actual TCV.
- At the same time it is good to have an increased efficiancy in terms of TCV margin in our existing top countries for absolute TCV like United States & Switzerland.
- Same case with the services we offer as Consulting & Business Solutions are the on top in terms of TCV margin percentage but they are amongst the lowest in terms of absolute TCV value.
- Though Digital Assets & Data Center services are the lowest in terms of TCV margin percentage but they are bringing highest absolute TCV value for the company.
